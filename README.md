#  Airbnb Clone Project

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a real-world, full-stack development initiative aimed at building a scalable booking platform inspired by Airbnb. This project focuses on backend development, database design, API creation, application security, and collaborative software workflows.



##  About the Project

This project provides hands-on experience with building a robust booking system. We will dive deep into backend systems, API development, database design, application security, and modern team collaboration practices. It also simulates working in a real-world team environment with scalable architecture and efficient workflows.



##  Learning Objectives

- Master collaborative workflows using **GitHub**.
-  Deepen understanding of **backend architecture** and **database design principles**.
-  Implement **advanced security measures** for API development.
-  Design and manage **CI/CD pipelines** for efficient deployment.
-  Strengthen skills in **documenting and planning complex software projects**.
-  Develop expertise in integrating technologies like **Django**, **MySQL**, and **GraphQL**.


## ðŸ›  Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Django 
- **Database:** MySQL
- **API:** GraphQL
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Deployment:** CI/CD Pipelines


##  Team Roles

- **Project Manager:** Oversees project planning, sets deadlines, and coordinates the team.
- **Backend Developers:** Build APIs, manage database models, implement business logic, and ensure application security.
- **Database Administrators:** Design, optimize, and maintain the database schemas.
- **DevOps Engineers:** Set up CI/CD pipelines and manage deployment infrastructure.
- **Documentation Specialist:** Create and maintain detailed technical documentation.
- **QA/Testers:** Ensure application quality through systematic testing and reporting of bugs.

## Database Design
** key entities for this project are: **
- Users
- properties
- Bookings
- Reviews
- payments

## Feature Breakdown
- **User management :** Creating, editing and deleting users for the system
- **Property management :** Creating, editing and deleting properties for booking.
- **Booking system :** Booking the listed properties.
- **Payment:** Managing the payemnt of the property by users.

  ## API Security
  Securing the API and the application is important for both userrs data and mantaining system integrity
  Key Ways:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Rate limiting
